# TarsGPT: Detailed Guide to Building a Replica of TARS from Interstellar

Welcome to the detailed guide for building your own replica of TARS, the iconic robot from the movie Interstellar. This project, named TarsGPT, will walk you through every step needed to create your functional robot.

## Introduction

TARS, the iconic robot from the film Interstellar, has been a source of inspiration for many robotics and movie enthusiasts. Thanks to the work of Charles Diaz and other contributors, it is now possible to build a functional replica of TARS using easily accessible components and 3D printing techniques. This guide will provide you with all the information necessary to complete the TarsGPT project.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Prepare CAD Files
1. Download the CAD files from the links provided in the original guide.
2. Open the CAD files in your preferred 3D modeling software.
3. Ensure all parts are correctly dimensioned and ready for printing.

### Step 2: 3D Print the Parts
1. Load the CAD files into your 3D slicing software.
2. Configure the printing settings (temperature, speed, infill, etc.).
3. Start printing all the necessary robot parts, including leg components and the body.

### Step 3: Assemble the Printed Parts
1. Once all parts are printed, begin assembly following the instructions provided in the original guide links.
2. Use glue or adhesive tape to secure parts together if necessary.
3. Ensure all parts are properly aligned and that the joints are movable.

### Step 4: Mount the Servo Motors
1. Place the servo motors in their designated printed slots.
2. Secure the servo motors using screws or glue.
3. Connect the servo motors to the Raspberry Pi using connection cables.

### Step 5: Electronic Wiring
1. Connect the Raspberry Pi and servo motors to the breadboard using jumper wires.
2. Ensure all connections are correct and secure.
3. Connect the power supply to the Raspberry Pi and servo motors.

### Step 6: Program the Raspberry Pi
1. Download the control code from the links provided in the original guide.
2. Upload the code to the Raspberry Pi.
3. Configure the code to control the servo motors and test the leg movement of the robot.

### Step 7: Testing and Calibration
1. Power on the robot and observe the leg movement.
2. Adjust the code and servo motor positions to achieve smooth and stable movement.
3. Test the robot on different surfaces to ensure it functions correctly in various environments.
